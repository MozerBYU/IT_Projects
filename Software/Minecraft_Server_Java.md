# Automated Minecraft Server Deployment in Linux
## Introduction

Nothing is sweeter than setting up you're very own Minecraft Server for you and your family and friends to play on. But there can be a lot of hassle getting it all setup. Especially in automating the process. In this I will demonstrate all the steps of what to do to set it up. Eventually I will have a script that will do all the install for you, but that is still in the works.

*Note: This is strictly for Minecraft Java Version. Bedrock is coming later. Stay tuned.*

*Note: All of the following steps will be done on a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, but this can be replicated as far back as Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Debian 8.*

## Part 1 â€“ Package Installation and Security Updates

To begin, we'll setup a fresh install of Ubuntu/Debian. Like with every new server install, make sure you have the latest package and security updates.

> `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

Next, we have some packages to install:

> `sudo apt install -y openjdk-#-jre screen ufw unattended-upgrades wget`

*Note: The following are optional packages if you are planning to use Github for cloud backups of your server.*

> `sudo apt install -y git`

*Note: You'll need to replace <#> with the one appropriate to the version of Minecraft you'll be on.*

| Minecraft Version | Compatible Java Version |
| :------: | :------: |
| <= 1.11 | Java 7 | 
| 1.12 - 1.13 | Java 8 |
| 1.14 - 1.16 | Java 11 | 
| 1.17 - 1.19 | Java 17 |

*Note: You can run Minecraft 1.16 on Java 8, though it is recommended to run the latest verison of Java the Minecraft server supports. But anything past 1.17 you are **required** to run Java 17 or the server will crash.

To explain each of the packages we are installing: 
- Git: is a package for Git that I like for moving files around easily
- Openjdk-#-jre: is the package for the Java software that runs the Minecraft server
- Screen: is a package used by the screen software to run our Minecraft server as a background process.
- UFW: is a package that is used by the UFW (uncomplicated firewall) that we'll use to lock down our Minecraft server ports
- Unattended-upgrades: is the package used for automating security update installation to keep our Minecraft server secure
- Wget: is a package used to download the minecraft server jar files that we'll need

*Note: You don't have to use screen, you can also use tmux or similar. But screen is the one chosen in this tutorial and in the script file that you will download*

## Setup Firewall Rules

In order for your Minecraft server to accessible to greater internet, you'll need to setup Port Forwarding or similar. We will not demonstrate how that is done. But look up articles on Reddit, Facebook, Stackoverflow or you're respective router's company website to find information on how to do so.

Suffice to say, you need to designate a port on your router that is open to the internet that you will use to connect to your Minecraft server. By default, that port is 25565 running on the TCP protocol. Now you can choose to keep this default port, or you can change it. It's up to you. All that it changes is how your Minecraft client connects to the server.

For ease of explaining this process, we will use the default 25565/tcp port for our use case. So we'll need to add that to our firewall rules using UFW.

> `sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp`

Additionally, you can choose to add an SSH access port if you so desire.

> `sudo ufw allow ssh`

or 

> `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`

After you have all your firewall rules setup, you'll want to make sure the firewall is enabled and set to automatically run on system start up.

> `sudo ufw enable`

## Minecraft Server Download

Next, you'll need to head over to Minecraft's official site for the download link for whichever version of Minecraft your going to run. 

https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server

This is the download link for 1.19.2:

https://piston-data.mojang.com/v1/objects/f69c284232d7c7580bd89a5a4931c3581eae1378/server.jar

If you aren't able to find the version you want, they are also archived at this website:

https://mcversions.net/

Now, before we actually download it we need to make a new directory for our Minecraft server files to live in. I like using the /var directory, but it really doesn't matter where you put it as long as you secure it down.

> `sudo mkdir /var/minecraft`
> `<br> cd /var/minecraft`

Next, we'll use wget to get our Minecraft server jar file.

> `wget <insert_copy_link>`

That will pull down the file that should be simliar to "server.jar". 

*Note: The name of the Minecraft server jar file doesn't make a big difference, as long as you change the name of the jar file that the startup file we'll download in a second is looking for. They need to match or the server will fail.*

## Build Server Framework 

Now that we have our server jar file, we need to create a simple bash script that will run that jar and populate the server framework directory including the EULA.txt file that we'll edit.

That script looks like the following (and is included in ![Files](/files/minecraft/minecraft-startup.sh) of this for reference).

> `java -Xmx1024M -Xms512M -jar server.jar -nogui`

*Note: Don't worry about tweaking these values, as this is just to setup the framework of our Minecraft server. We'll tweak them later for the actual server.* 

You can create this file using nano, vim, or whatever text editor you prefer. Or you can simply download it from "files". 

Next, we need to run that file to actual populate our framework:

> `./minecraft-startup.sh`

After that we need to edit the EULA.txt file to "true". Again, you can use a text editor for this, or you can run the following command:

> `echo eula=true > eula.txt`

## Create Minecraft System User and Group

For security and ease of automation, we're going to create a user for our Minecraft server to run under. Naturally, we'll call both minecraft, haha.

This can be done in many ways, but I will show you the way I like to use.

> `sudo groupadd minecraft`
> <br> `sudo adduser minecraft --system`
> <br> `sudo usermod -aG minecraft minecraft`

What this is doing is creating a group for minecraft. Creating a system user (can't be logged into), but with the inital group of 'nobody'. We then change it's group to minecraft.

## Import World if needed

The cool thing about creating servers, is you can create a new fresh install (and even set the seed). Or you can use existing "world" files. 

Now if you are using a desktop gui version of Ubuntu/Debian, you'll have a much easier time. If you're like me and are using the server edition, the easiest method I have found for moving the file around in the commandline is by using Git. You can use a Git server of your choice, even your own if you have one. In my case, I choose to use Git LFS provided by Github, as it is specifically designed for large files

**If you opt to not use git, you can ignore this whole section.**

*Note: I won't be covering very much about git in this tutorial. Just the basics of creating a repo, adding the world files, pushing it up to the cloud. And then pulling back down on the desired machine.*

You may be wondering why I've chosen to use Git, and not something else. I like Git because it does versioning. Which is how I a lot of my cloud backups for my Minecraft servers. Granted, I have several backups running. These are *some* of my off-shore backups that I have in place. 

First on your local computer, install Git. Next, you'll want to create a directory for your Git repository to live in (which will put that "world" folder in later). To do this you'll run the following commands:

> `git init -b main`
> <br> `git add .`
> <br> `git -m "Initial commit"` *(Don't ask me why, but it has to be 'Initial commit' or **it will break**)*

Now, you need to go to GitHub and create a repository for your Minecraft server to live in. Once that is complete we can then tell git to push our server files up to the cloud.

> `git remote origin add https://<git server repository>`
> <br> `git remote -v`
> <br> `git push origin main`

Once you have your git repository created and the world file added to that repository, we're ready to clone it down. Which can be done by using git clone.

> `sudo git clone https://<git_server>/<user>/<repository_for_minecraft>`
  
From there, just make sure that your world folder is in the right location in /var/minecraft.

## Set Filesystem Permissions

Now a very important note. Most of the work we have been doing has either been as root or a sudo user. But our Minecraft server will be running as the minecraft user. So we need to change some permissions on /var/minecraft or it will break when you try to run it. Using the following command will allow us to setup the correct permissions on the /var/minecraft folder and everything in it.
  
> `sudo chown -R minecraft:minecraft /var/minecraft`

## Minecraft Security Log4j Warning

If you are running a server between Minecraft 1.7 and 1.18 then it is **absolutely imperative that you follow these directions**. If you are not familiar with Log4j and all of the ramifications from the discovery of that vulnerability, then do yourself a quick favor and do a quick Google search.

This is the link to the official article about it from Minecraft:

https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4416199399693-Security-Vulnerability-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition

Suffice to say, it is a major problem and could allow **complete take over** of your Minecraft server, and the VM/container that is running it if you do not mitigate this vulnerability.

Lucky for you, Minecraft has a released such mitigation. You can download those files directly from the link above, or I have them included in the files for this tutorial. 

![Log4j v1.12 - v1.26 XML Files](/files/minecraft/log4j2_112-116.xml)

![Log4j v1.7 - v1.11 XML Files](/files/minecraft/log4j2_17-111.xml)

I will demonstrate where in the run file for the Minecraft server that you need to include that mitigation, per Minecraft's official instructions. Reference them as you wish.
  
Below is our original run script for the Minecraft Server:
  
> `java -Xmx1024M -Xms512M -jar server.jar -nogui`
  
Here is the edited version with the Log4j mitigation in place:

> `java -Xmx1024M -Xms512M -Dlo4j.configurationFile=log4j2_<version>.xml -jar server.jar -nogui`

## Server Automation using Systemd

Now, we have everything in place. However, there is a bit of problem. Everytime your server/VM/container kicks off and has to restart, you would originally need to re-run that minecraft-startup.sh file. But that can get hectic if you don't have a VPN or other remote access option available. This my friend is where the beauty of service files comes in.

The script I provide is a modified and simplified verison of the original script found here:

https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Server_startup_script

I edited it for simplicities sake for single Minecraft server instance installs. I will include the original script in "files" if you wish to use the other, with some of my modifications necessary in order to make it actually run. Yes, you're welcome world. It took me a while to figure that out.

![Simplified Minecraft Service File](/files/minecraft/minecraft.service)

![Original-Edited Minecraft Service File](/files/minecraft/original-minecraft.service)

## Miscellanous History

**Skip if you don't care about the history of why I edited the public script.**

History time, so I was in a spot where I was using tmux and manually going in everytime to start my Minecraft servers using `bash minecraft-startup.sh`. Note, I was running 5 Minecraft servers at that time, each with their own VM. So I had to repeat this process 5 times, everytime I had a server go down or had to run maintenance or cloud backups.

As you can imagine this painstaking process was rather frustrating. So I did a good bit of research on StackOverFlow, Minecraft Fandom and r/Minecraft and r/FeedtheBeast (aka ModdedMinecraft). Which eventually led me to learn about Linux Service files as a means of automating running a service, or process, on system startup. 

After some more digging I came across that articl I referenced above. I was so excited to copy it and get to work. However, soon thereafter I ran into some problems. This original script is for deploying several Minecraft servers to a given machine via minecraft-x.service. Which in my case, I have each Minecraft server on a seperate VM/container and so that didn't really matter to me. Additionally, there were some issues with how the script was setup where the server would die in a matter of seconds, but then endless attempt to restart itself to then die agian. This issue had the most ambiguous error messages (don't ask, it's been over a year and a half and I don't remember, nor care now). 

Suffice to say, one error was related to the command "Type=forking". Which I modified to be "Type=simple". As I noted in my modification, the following StackOverFlow discussion has a fairly good explanation of the issue: 

https://askubuntu.com/questions/953920/systemctl-service-timed-out-during-start

That modification solved the issue of the server dying at instant speed and endless trying to restart. But then I had another issue encountered in the "ExecStart" section of this beast:

![Original ExecStart Script](/assets/minecraft/original-execstart-script.png)

This had to be modified as well, by myself, so that screen was invoked by the process prior to invoking Java. Otherwise, screen was called after Java and it would crash the heck out of the server. Also, as I will get to later, none of the backups worked properly.

![Modified ExecStart Script)(/assets/minecraft/modified-execstart-script.png)

However, like I mentioned, I didn't need the functionality of create multiple Minecraft server instances on a given VM/container. So I stripped away that functionality for ease of reading and ease of use with the script for my own purposes. If you're setup is simliar to mine then you'll want the simplified script. If not, then feel free to use the modified version of the original script.

Insert more history about how this tutorial came to be.
          
## Server Backups  
You can rely on automated backups, which I'll demonstrate just below. Or you can do a manual one by doing the following:
  
> `cp /var/minecraft/world /var/minecraft/world.backup`

Insert more about automated backups.

## Additional Notes

### Server Updating
  
A word of caution. Before you do **any** upgrade from one major version to another, make sure to do your research. With minor verisons, like 1.91.1 to 1.19.2 there usually isn't an issue. But regardless, always, *always* make a backup of your world before doing an upgrade. Granted, backups of your Minecraft server should be part of your routine maintenance, which were shown previously.
 
## Troubleshooting
  
Errors with starting the Minecraft server can be attributed to a simple subset of a few things:
  
- 1) You have the Minecraft service file looking for the wrong directory
- 2) You have the wrong permissions set on /var/minecraft
- 3) You have the wrong version of Java appropriate to your verison of Minecraft
